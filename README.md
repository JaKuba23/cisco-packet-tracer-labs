# Cisco Packet Tracer Labs – Networking Portfolio

This repository collects my hands-on networking labs built in Cisco Packet Tracer.  
Each lab is a small, focused scenario that demonstrates core network skills.


## How to Use These Labs

1. Open the `.pkt` file for the lab in Cisco Packet Tracer (tested with recent 8.x versions). [web:83][web:138]
2. Review the IP addressing and design in the lab `README.md` (VLAN IDs, subnets, gateways).
3. Either:
   - rebuild the lab from scratch using the configs as a reference, or  
   - load the `.pkt` file and inspect the running configuration on each device with `show running-config`.
4. Use `ping` and basic `show` commands (`show ip interface brief`, `show vlan brief`, `show interfaces trunk`) to verify connectivity and routing between VLANs. [web:252][web:262][web:265]

These labs are intentionally small and repeatable so they can be used for daily practice and interview preparation.
